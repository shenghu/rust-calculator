## Brief overview

Project-specific guidelines for creating GitHub issues that follow the proper templates and structure user input appropriately.

## Issue template usage

- When creating GitHub issues, always follow the corresponding template in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder
- Map user-provided information to the appropriate template sections
- Use proper issue types (feature request, bug report, etc.) based on the content

## Type of issues

- For user story, use template `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/story-template.md`
- For bug/defect, use template `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md`
- For feature request, use template `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md`

## Content organization

- Maintain clear separation between problem, solution, and context
- Preserve user's original wording and intent when mapping to template sections
- Ensure acceptance criteria are clearly stated and testable
